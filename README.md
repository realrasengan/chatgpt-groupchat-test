# ChatGPT Group Chat Test

Letting ChatGPT decide if and when to respond in a group chat.

## Introduction

I wanted to see if ChatGPT could decide when to participate in a group chat. The simple test is live right now in #freenode.


## Try it yourself

Just install `irc-framework`, `openai`, and put your API key in a file called `secret` and set some variables in bot.js and go!
